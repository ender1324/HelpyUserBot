``Incase your Redis session renders invalid, stop your dyno & run the userbot locally again, it will delete your old session from Redis. Then re-run the userbot again, login and exit it and start your dyno on Heroku.``

# 

## Requirements:

- Python 3.7.3 or above.
- A Telegram [API key][tg-apps] (API ID and hash).
- Redis Endpoint and Password from [Redis Labs][redis]
   - Redis session is optional but needed if you are planning to use AFK and PM-Permit.

## Procedure:

Clone the repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ender1324/Helpy-UserBot-experiement/ helpybutt
```

Change the current directory to the cloned one.

```sh
$ cd helpybutt
```

Edit the config either using Nano/Vim or a Text Editor and put your ENV Vars in the same.
```sh
$ nano sample_config.ini
$ mv sample_config.ini config.ini
```

Install all the requirements using pip.

```sh
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

$ python3 -m userbot
```
